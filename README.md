Day 0 - Submitted my 3 choices for the game: Tetris, Snake & Connect 4. Knowing that Tetris was the hardest of them all, I've been encouraged to challenge myself and go ahead with the hardest choice, Tetris has been my Nr.1 choice from the second I've seen all of the 10 games I could build. After deciding that I will be building Tetris, I was extremely excited and went on researching Tetris to it's fullest. Upon my searches I have found vast amounts of information about the game and it's different variations. The website that stuck with me the most was (https://www.arkmay.com/tetris/pieces.html) and where the most basic familiarisation with all the aspects of the game happened (https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Wiki). The logic was flowing, confidence was up until I realised it was the hardest game out of them all.
