## Overview

My implementation of classic Tetris game, built only using vanilla Javascript, CSS & HTML. I had a choice to pick from 10 different games and my original shortlist has been Connect 4, Snake & Tetris. Tetris has been my number 1 choice as I loved the game since I was a kid, although I knew that it would potentially be the most challenging game of them all.

### Timeframe 
7 days

## Brief
* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Be built on a grid: do not use HTML Canvas for this**
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**

## Technologies Used
+ HTML5 with HTML5 audio
+ CSS3
+ JavaScript (ES6)
+ Git/ Github
+ Google Fonts

### Controls
+ Press ``start`` button to start the game
+ ``<-`` to move left ``->`` to move right
+ ``â†“`` to drop tetromino down
+ No rotation of tetriminos available right now.

### Process 

 I was extremely excited and went on researching Tetris to its fullest. Upon my searches I have found vast amounts of information about the game and it's different variations. I've spent the first day of the project replaying the game and familiarising myself with the rules mostly researching it on [Tetris Fandom](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Wiki).
 
 I've decided to start my project with getting one colored block to move down the grid, add collision detection on left and right as well as bottom and then move to spawning another block and repeating the process. 
 
 
 ### Wins
 + Managed to build an almost fully working browser rendered Tetris game, even after the hurdle of extreme imposter syndrome.
 + Clearing rows and moving blocks down after it's cleared. It was great to complete one of the major game conditions pretty easily. I definitely harnessed my ability to use different Javascript methods to complete the row clearing function in my game.
 
 ### Challenges
 + Rotation of tetrominoes has been the biggest challenges and something that I didn't have enough time to complete mainly due to needing to scrap my project halfway through and start all over again.
 + Collision detection. Dealing with collision detection has been a challenge for sure, with every tetromino being formed of 4 differently arranged blocks has proven to be difficult.
 + Poor planning has led to needing to scrap my project 4 days into it and start all over again, which has been a challenging experience for my self confidence as a developer.
 
 
 ### Key learnings
 + The major learning experience in this project wasn't to do with coding at all. It was an emotional experience as I was really doubting my abilities as a developer at first hand try at the game, but managed to put my imposter syndrome behind and produce a kickass looking game
 + First use of event listeners and DOM.
 + Javascript fundamentals. The hardest hurdle has been building the confidence in writing JS logic and building Tetris which is extremely heavy on logic has been a great learning experience.
